# CheckersAI
Welcome to the AI Checkers project repository! This project leverages AI techniques to create an advanced Checkers game experience. Our system integrates multiple AI methodologies, providing diverse and challenging gameplay options. Below is a brief overview of the key features:

## Features
### 1. ACO-based Neural Network Training
Utilizes Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) to train a Neural Network, enhancing its decision-making abilities and improving its gameplay strategy.

### 2. Minimax with Alpha-Beta Pruning vs Human
Implements the Minimax algorithm with Alpha-Beta Pruning for efficient game tree exploration, allowing for a challenging AI opponent when playing against humans.

### 3. Neural Network vs Human
Engage in a match against an AI opponent powered by a Neural Network trained using ACO, offering a unique and adaptive gameplay experience.

### 4. Alpha-Beta Pruning vs Neural Network
Pit the Minimax algorithm with Alpha-Beta Pruning against the ACO-trained Neural Network to observe different AI strategies in action and determine which approach is superior.

## Getting Started
To get started with the AI Checkers project, follow the instructions in the Installation Guide.
